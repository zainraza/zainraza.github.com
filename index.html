<h4>Senior Software Architect, WorldNow, New York June 2004 – February 2006</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Lead a team of three to launch WorldNow’s video player with features such as pre/post roll video ads, companion ads, user and publisher playlists, video search, sharing, closed captioning, related content ticker and real time weather bug.</li>
  <li>Interfaced with Clients during requirements gathering.</li>
  <li>Developed a robust feed parsing system that would allow national content from AP, Reuters and AccuWeather to be made available within the CMS system. The application supported custom templates per feed type and a web UI to manage settings. Designed the database schema along with identifying the indices. Set up performance measuring counters on the database and application boxes such as CPU, Memory and Disk IO were added using MS Profiler.</li>

<h4>VP Engineering, Mobdub LLC, New York, NY  April 2008 – January 2012</h4>
<p>Was part of a four person start up team. We built a commenting system with a rich set of moderation tools.  We also developed an iOS and Android app. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Developed a video annotation flash application which renders on top most video players and allows publishers to add textual hotspot regions to the video synchronized with the video time. http://mobdub.com/platform.html#video</li>
  <li>Built a JavaScript widget that allows users to comment on specific times in a video. The widget highlights and auto scrolls to the comment made at the time as the video plays. The same widget can be used for other forms of non-time based content including articles. http://mobdub.com/platform.html#commenting</li>
  <li>These widgets also support the inclusion of a Twitter feed based on various search criteria. The result is a real time feed targeted to the video/article content allowing the users to tweet straight from the widget. Users can sign-in using Facebook Connect, Twitter’s authentication system and OpenID (including Google and Yahoo). In addition, integration with a custom registration system is also possible.</li>
  <li>Helped with the development of the Android app. The app reads rss feeds from clients and renders the content in a categorized format. It also supports video playback. https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Mobdub+LLC </li>
